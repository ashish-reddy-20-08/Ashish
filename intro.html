                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am Munagala Ashish Reddy  pursing Bachelor of Technology third year in Computer Science and Engineering (HONS.) at Lovely Professional University.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Running back down the lane, I have worked at 3 organisations for the roles of data scientist, and Machine Leanring.In one of the internships at Girl Script Winter of Contributing’21 as the OpenSource Contributor, I was the top 1 contributor in the field of Machine Learning with 42+ successfully merged pull requests and also among the top 3 contributors in the fields of Data Science With Python and Data Science with R with 104+ successfully merged pull requests.

                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I also possess leadership qualities, good time management skills, and good communication skills, which I learned while working as the Chief Operating Officer of the event management company and also as a volunteer for 2 organizations, where I put my hand into helping the needy. I am also a spokesperson at Leher app and also won the 3rd prize in the National level storytelling competition.  I believe that I own strong theoretical knowledge along with practical applications which I've gained over the 14 months. Exploration and research are always challenging tasks and trying to draw some of the best insights with the help of my teammates make me feel happy. I will surely try to fulfil my superiors’ expectations which helps me to improve my skills in the field by getting hands-on experience and also having all the skills to work with the team. I also will be really excited to work since it improves my both professional and personal skills in the industry and I take each opportunity as a step towards reaching my career goal.

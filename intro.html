                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am Ashish Reddy Munagala pursing Bachelor of Technology third year in Computer Science and Engineering (HONS.) at Lovely Professional University.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have been working consistently for about 10 months, where I have done 3 internships in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning, during which in one of the internships at Girl Script Winter of Contributing’21 as the OpenSource Contributor, I was the top 1 contributor in the field of Machine Learning with 42+ successfully merged pull requests and also among the top 3 contributors in the fields of Data Science With Python and Data Science with R with 104+ successfully merged pull requests and now I am presently working at Script Winter Of Code’21, where I am part of 3 projects, and also an active participant in hackathons and Ideathons which made me expertise in dealing with real-time applications. During my first internship in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, I have faced a few hurdles, but during the course of time, I understood how things work in the reality and which methods and procedures are to be used, in this way I shaped myself into an industry-ready person. During my course of study in the domains of Data Science and Machine Learning, I have also learnt Tableau which really helped me to visualize the data better. I have worked on different kinds of projects using algorithms such as Logistic regression, Decision tree, SVM algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, KNN algorithm, K-means, Random Forest algorithm, Dimensionality reduction algorithms, Gradient boosting algorithm, AdaBoosting algorithm, etc. both while learning and working. Apart from this I also developed my skills in Python. Working with python is always spellbinding, I have been using it for almost 2 years and now, I got acquainted with almost all the libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc that are used in Machine Learning and Data Science. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I also possess leadership qualities, good time management skills, and good communication skills, which I learned while working as the Chief Operating Officer of the event management company and also as a volunteer for 2 organizations, where I put my hand into helping the needy. I am also a spokesperson at Leher app and also won the 3rd prize in the National level storytelling competition. On the technical side, I have extensive experience working with statistical, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. I believe that I own strong theoretical knowledge along with practical applications which I've gained over the 14 months. Exploration and research are always challenging tasks and trying to draw some of the best insights with the help of my teammates make me feel happy. I will surely try to fulfil my superiors’ expectations which helps me to improve my skills in the field by getting hands-on experience and also having all the skills to work with the team. I also will be really excited to work since it improves my both professional and personal skills in the industry and I take each opportunity as a step towards reaching my career goal of being the Chief Data Scientist. I will be privileged to work under your guidance during the Internship Program. I look forward to hearing from you for any further queries. Thank you for your time and consideration.
